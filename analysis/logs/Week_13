### Date: 
Week 13, April 11, 2025 


### Number of hours: 
28 hours total (Sindhu: 13 hours on EDA and findings for trend analysis visualizations, Ram: 15 hours on trend analysis parts 1 & 2 and half of part 3)

### Rose:
We successfully completed parts 1 & 2 of the EDA and trend analysis, providing a solid foundation for our project's next steps.

### Bud: 
Next week, we plan to complete the remaining trend analysis (part 3) and begin working on the Course Bottleneck Index (CBI). We are also excited to initiate predictive analysis after discussing it further with our mentors, Sean and Dr. Chism.

### Thorn: 
Unfortunately, we missed our scheduled meeting with Sean due to a Wi-Fi breakdown at home. Attempts to reschedule were unsuccessful, highlighting the need for better contingency plans in communication and scheduling.

## Additional thought
We will ensure consistent updates on our progress once the GitHub repository is established. Additionally, we must prioritize attending future meetings with Sean, as we have several key topics and questions to discuss.
