### Number of hours: 
21 hours total (Sindhu: 8 hours, Ram: 13 hours)
### Rose:
We had a productive meeting with Sean where we were able to discuss our datasets and the Course Bottleneck Index (CBI). Given the limited time left, Sean advised us to pause predictive analysis and instead focus on deeper, more meaningful data analysis.

### Bud: 
Following Sean’s feedback, we will revise our trend and CBI analysis to focus more specifically on term-by-term and year-by-year insights. We plan to create visualizations—, especially heat maps, that clearly highlight areas needing improvement.

### Thorn: 
Unfortunately, much of our previous analysis needs to be redone with more detailed and focused insights. This will require additional time and effort, but we are committed to improving the quality of our results.

## Additional thought
We’ve decided to create an interactive dashboard to present the findings from our refined CBI analysis, aiming to make the insights more accessible and impactful.
