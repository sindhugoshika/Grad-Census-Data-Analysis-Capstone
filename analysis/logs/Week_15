### Number of hours:
35 hours total (Sindhu: 20 hours, Ram: 15 hours)
### Rose:
We worked extensively on both the CBI analysis and trend analysis this week. We used heatmaps to visualize enrollment fill rates, which helped highlight course scheduling patterns clearly.

### Bud:
We decided to build an interactive dashboard for the CBI analysis. Based on Seanâ€™s feedback, we planned to incorporate additional information such as meeting time and meeting days to make the dashboard more insightful.

### Thorn:
Since we were new to building interactive dashboards, it took us a significant amount of time to understand the tools and develop a functional and meaningful design.
