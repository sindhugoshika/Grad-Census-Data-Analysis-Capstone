### Rose:
As Morgan took initiative to do data cleaning, Sindhu completed most of the Statement of Work (SOW) document, and Ram prepared a draft of KDD by modalities. This draft significantly improved our understanding of the data and will update the project proposal document accordingly.

### Bud: 
We clearly defined and assigned specific analytical tasks to each team member, aiming for completion by our next internal meeting:

1. KDD by modality
2. Analyzing different enrollment trends across various course formats over recent years
3. Identifying consistently filled classes
4. Identifying classes infrequently offered but highly filled when available

### Thorn: 
Morgan missed our internal team meeting but rescheduled it for the next day. 
Sindhu and Ram unfortunately missed a meeting with Sean, highlighting a need for better planning around scheduling and attendance.

Additionally, as Morgan was occupied with her other class responsibilities, Sindhu and Ram took the initiative to work on the SOW document. However, they were later blamed for proceeding without prior discussion, indicating a communication gap that needs to be addressed.
