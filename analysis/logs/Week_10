Week 10, March 21, 2025  

### Rose:
Morgan took initiative to handle data cleaning, as she said she is strongest in this area. Sindhu and Ram focused on developing and refining the research questions.

### Bud: 
Next week, we plan to clearly define tasks and responsibilities for each team member. Sean expressed interest in comparative analysis between undergraduate and graduate data, meaning our trend analysis will need to be performed separately for these two categories.

### Thorn: 
Despite agreeing to regularly check Slack and email daily, communication misunderstandings persist, and we have been inaccurately criticized for not staying responsive. Improving clarity and frequency of updates remains a priority. 

### Additional thought:
Establishing clearer expectations around communication frequency could help mitigate misunderstandings moving forward.
