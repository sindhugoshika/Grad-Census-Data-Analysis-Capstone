### Date: 
Week 12, April 4, 2025 


### Number of hours: 
18 hours total (Sindhu: 10 hours, Ram: 8 hours) 

### Rose:
Our target for this week is to complete the project proposal as we were just left with a 1 day after creating a new sub team and We are happy to report that the project proposal was completed on time and successfully submitted.

### Bud: 
Fortunately, Dr. Greg and Sean decided to divide the team into two groups: undergraduate and graduate. Moving forward, we will focus solely on graduate courses. As a result, we now need to revise and resubmit our SOW document before the deadline.

Next week, we look forward to engaging deeply in data exploration and trend analysis, which will be crucial in preparing for our upcoming meeting with our mentor, Sean.

### Thorn: 
Despite significant contributions, our teammate complained that Sindhu and Ram were not taking tasks seriously, which was disheartening. She expressed a desire for us to be available on weekends due to her full-time job and other classes, but we are available on week days which lead to misunderstandings.

## Additional thought
We will prioritize regular updates and detailed documentation once our GitHub repository is established.
