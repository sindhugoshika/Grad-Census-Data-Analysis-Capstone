### Number of hours:
43 hours total (Sindhu: 25 hours, Ram: 18 hours)
### Rose:
We successfully completed the dashboard and received positive feedback from Sean. While there were a few suggested changes, we were glad to hear that the submission deadline was extended to Sunday, May 4th.

### Bud:
Following Sean’s suggestions, we modified the x-axis on the Demand Ratio visual to better represent academic terms and also fixed a display issue with the Offering Frequency Score. Sean also requested a simple executive summary to capture our key reflections on the project.

### Thorn:
Although we’re happy with the progress, there are still a number of changes to be made, and time is limited. However, we remain committed to finishing everything before the final deadline.

## Additional thought
We’re excited to wrap up the project. It’s been a rewarding journey filled with challenges, collaboration, and valuable learning experiences.
